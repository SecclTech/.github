# Welcome to Seccl

We’re a custodian and investment technology provider. Our software and APIs empower advisers and DFMs to run their own platform, and help fintechs get to market fast. So what does that mean?

1. We help forward-thinking financial advisers and investment managers to improve their client experience, lower their costs and take control of their business – by operating their own platform.
2. We help ambitious fintechs to launch new investment propositions more quickly and easily than ever – by building directly onto our affordable and scalable investment API.
          
## Stack
